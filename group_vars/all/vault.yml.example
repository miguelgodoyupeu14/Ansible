# Example vault variables file. DO NOT commit unencrypted secrets to source control.
# Encrypt this file with `ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/all/vault.yml` and remove this .example suffix.
# Then run playbooks with --ask-vault-pass or --vault-password-file as appropriate.

# Vaulted passwords used by roles/playbooks
vault_backup_user_password: "Upeu2024#"
vault_admin_password: "Upeu2024#"
# If you use the Linux account 'miguelgod' password here, include it too (example):
vault_miguel_password: "12345678"

# Add any other secret variables here (API keys, service account passwords, etc.).
